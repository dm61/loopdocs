Loop provides the following local notifications on the Loop iPhone:

* <font color ="orange">**Loop failure**</font>  At 20, 40, 60, and 120 minutes, there is a Loop Failure notification.

* <font color ="orange">**Low Reservoir**</font>  At 20% and 10% remaining reservoir volume, there is a Low Reservoir notification.

* <font color ="orange">**Empty Reservoir**</font>  Loop will notify when reservoir is empty.

* <font color ="orange">**Low Battery**</font> Loop will notify when battery levels have approximately 8-10 hours of battery life remaining.

* <font color ="orange">**Bolus failure**</font>  If Loop detects that a bolus was not able to be delivered, it will provide a notification.  Bolus failures are usually due to stale pump data.  Try fetching recent history from the RileyLink menu to update pump data.  Loop will also notify of partial bolus deliveries.

Loop does not have remote notification to other devices.  If you are a remotely monitoring parent, you will want to read [here](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/nightscout/pushover/#pushover) about setting up pushover alerts using your Nightscout site if you want proactive notifications of looping related information.
