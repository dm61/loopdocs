# Health App

Loop app uses the iPhone's Health app to store BGs, insulin, and carbohydrate data.  Insulin Data is a new feature with iOS 11.  You can check your Health App settings for Loop by opening the Health App, clicking on Sources at the bottom bar, and then clicking on the Loop app.

If you toggle on the "add to favorites" slider like the carbohydrates view in the screenshot above, the data from those categories will be added to your Today view for easy quick reference and access.
