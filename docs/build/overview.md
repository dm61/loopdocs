# Building your Loop

Building your Loop app is actually quite easy.  The harder part will be having the patience to read all the documents you should before starting a closed loop.  New Loop users are so excited to get started that they skip reading all the great info that these docs contain.  So, as you begin the build...please include time to read the documents that follow what happens AFTER you successfully build your Loop app.

If you have any questions, these docs have a nice search feature that may help you find your answers pretty quickly too.

The basic installation involves:

1. Making sure you have macOS Sierra and the application Xcode 9
2. Downloading the Loop code
3. Adding your Apple developer account to Xcode
4. Making some basic edits to the Loop code using Xcode
5. Signing your app with your Apple developer account
5. Pressing a "build" button to install the Loop app onto your iPhone
6. Entering the needed information (basals, etc) into Loop app to start using the looping features
